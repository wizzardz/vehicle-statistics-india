# Newly Registered Vehicles in India over the period of 2002 - 2012

### Why I am into this project?

I have started with Android development in early 2016 in a maintenance project. Having spent almost a year (not completely) in Android development using the default architecture I feel it’s time for me to move to a next level. I am a .net developer and I always loved working with architectures like MVC, MVP, MVVM etc. I wanted to apply these architectures in Android and see how that goes. This is the reason why I created this project, I wanted to embrace the principles of MVP, MVVM and Clean Architecture in an Android application and see how it goes. Hopefully whatever I learn in this project would help me in creating my dream (personal) project “Spenthrifter”.
As a first step I’ll we creating an android application in classical way and later, I’ll be rewriting the app in different architectures and using different technologies.

### What is this project?

What project should I choose? That was a difficult question to answer, I wanted to create a project which can be closely related to live scenarios and also helpful for me in the later projects. The app will run in both online and offline mode, but for the time being I am concentrating on the offline mode.


This is basically a data visualization app; it shows the statistics of new vehicles registered in all the states in India over a time period 2002-2012


The data for this project is taken from the website https://data.gov.in
